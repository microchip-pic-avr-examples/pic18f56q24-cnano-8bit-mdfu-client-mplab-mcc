/* 
"bootloaderIsRunning" is a single bit that is used to indicate when the bootloader is active.
When this is set to 1, interrupts will be handled by the bootloader's interrupt function(s).
When this is set to 0, interrupts will be handled by the application's interrupt function(s).
This file should be included into both the bootloader and the application so that memory 
associated with this flag is reserved in both parts.

The below addresses have been carefully chosen based on the memory configuration
of the specific architecture, and on resources the compiler or debuggers may 
reserve. 
PIC12IE, PIC14E and PIC14EX devices are more flexible with where the flag may 
be located. Anywhere in general purpose (banked) RAM will suffice. Unbanked RAM
should be avoided.
PIC14 and PIC18 devices differ. They must have the flag located in unbanked 
common/access RAM and the address must not conflict with, for example, memory
that may be reserved for compiler use or by debuggers. 

=> Only change if you understand all of the consequences.
